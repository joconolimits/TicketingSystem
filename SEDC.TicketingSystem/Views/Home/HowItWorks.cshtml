            Our ticket system is designed specifically to organize any kind of issues as they 
            are reported and helps keeping track of all fixes made , acting as an issue tracking 
            system as well. Every user can make his own account at the home page ,by clicking on
            the sign up button which will only require e-mail ,user name ,first name ,last name 
            and unique password information.
            <p class="container-fluid"> Its where we offer our customers modern login system
            allowing them to open tickets that connect directly to our administrators 
            and moderators receiving them via Email or the system itself.
